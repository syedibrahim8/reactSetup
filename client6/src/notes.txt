Why React?

While everything we do in react can technically be done in plain html,CSS, and Javascript, React allows:
- Better code reuse
- Large-scale performance in production
- Clean separation of concerns via components
- Easier maintenance and testing

Folder Structure
Industry Standard Folder Layout:

src/
|__ components/  # Reusable UI components
|__ pages/       # Page-specific components
|__ utils/       # Constants,helpers, and mock data

src = source folder. All app logic should reside here.
You are free to structure folders as you like,but the industry typically follows this conversion

.jsx vs .js - which one for components?

=> Use .jsx for files conatining Jsx

const MyComponent = () =>{
    return(
        <h1>Hello</h1>
    )
}
export default MyComponent;

pros of .jsx:

Clarity: Indicates the presence of Jsx
Better editor support (highlighting, linting)
Matches community convention

=> You can use .js, but...

cons:
-Misleading for JSX-containing files
-May confuse older tooling
-Less expressive in file lists

Best Practice:
Use .jsx for components.
Use .js for utilities, config, and non-JSX logic.

=> Constants & Static data
Don't keep large static data or hardcoded strings inside components

Instead, extract to utils/

export const CDN_LINK = "http://cdnlink.com";
export const URL = "https://ibbu.app";

// utils/mockdata.js
const data =[
    {
        //complete large data set
    }
]
export default data;

Export Tips:
Named export
// constant.js
export const CDN_LINK = "http://cdnlink.com";
export const URL = "https://ibbu.app";

//usage
import {CDN_LINKS,URL} from"../utils/constants";

Default export
//mockdata.js
export default data;

//usage
import data from "../utils/mockdata";

==> FILE SIZE GUIDELINES
-In companies like Uber, file length best practices:
-> Avoid files longer than 100 lines.
-> If you exceedded that, refactor into smaller components or files.
